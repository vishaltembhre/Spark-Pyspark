1
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,107
The wall Blackhaven

2
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,194
are unscalable vassalstone.

3
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:58,284
And the castle is surrounded
by a deep, dry moat.

4
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:02,914
It is well fortified against
any future Dornish incursions.

5
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:08,253
And though my seat
may be lesser in size,

6
00:02:08,336 --> 00:02:12,257
it is situated most pleasingly.

7
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:40,827
The view across the
Marches is inspiring,

8
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,789
so said Queen Alysanne herself
when she honored my father and I...

9
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:47,167
And tell me, Lord Dondarrion,

10
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:49,794
did you think my great-grandmother
as beautiful as they say?

11
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:56,009
This was half a century ago, Princess.

12
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,969
Yes, it was.

13
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:02,557
That was unseemly, Princess.

14
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,435
The man is older than my father.

15
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,854
It's unseemly for him
to put himself forward

16
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,856
as a contender for my hand.

17
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:12,608
Next!

18
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,330
And now a child.

19
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,292
The Black woods are an ancient house
with a formidable army.

20
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:34,631
In the River lands,
they once ruled as kings.

21
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:38,134
The blood of the First Men
still flows in their veins.

22
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:41,303
Go on.

23
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:45,350
My Princess...

24
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,310
ours is a bond that has long endured,

25
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:50,021
since Lucas Black wood,
the grand sire of my grand sire,

26
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,940
aided the Dragon in
his war of conquest...

27
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:55,902
Aye, the Black woods
truly turned the tide on that one.

28
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,323
Coursed with the blood of the First Men,

29
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,493
our history is deeply
rooted in this land,

30
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,537
which your house has made its home.

31
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,164
If chosen as your match, Princess...

32
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,583
your days shall be easy

33
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,920
and nights safe under my protection.

34
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,507
"Protection"? The Princess has a dragon,
you dumb cunt.

35
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,052
Bracken!

36
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,679
I could learn to like that one.

37
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:26,140
Let us have the next

38
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,434
so we may go to supper.

39
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:30,770
Craven.

40
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,024
We're leaving.

41
00:04:37,568 --> 00:04:40,113
Sheathe that steel, you twats!

42
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,991
Send word to the harbor
and have Captain Oswin ready the ship.

43
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,760
Princess, we're due in Bitter bridge
in three days' time.

44
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,679
I would happily row myself back
to King's Landing

45
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,788
if it brought an end
to this ridiculous pageant.

46
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,878
Don't look, Princess.

47
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,319
We should make landfall
inside the hour, Princess.

48
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,158
How do you think he will take it?

49
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:27,410
Do you speak of how you
rejected every suitor

50
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,638
His Grace put before you,
or how you abruptly ended the tour

51
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:30,830
with two months remaining?

52
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,098
Take cover!

53
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,770
Princess!

54
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:58,524
You all right? Are you?

55
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,526
- Fetch the maester!
- I'm fine.

56
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:54,038
It's Daemon.

57
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,189
Add it to the chair.

58
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,955
You wear a crown.

59
00:08:19,081 --> 00:08:20,833
Do you also call yourself "King"?

60
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,544
Once we smashed the Triarchy,

61
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,380
they named me "King of the Narrow Sea."

62
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,514
But I know that there
is only one true king, Your Grace.

63
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,026
My crown and the
Step stones... are yours.

64
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,199
Where is Lord Corlys?

65
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,368
He sailed home to Driftmark.

66
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:58,663
- Who holds the Step stones?
- The tides...

67
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:04,210
the crabs, and 2,000
dead Triarchy corsairs,

68
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,463
staked to the sand to warn
those who might follow.

69
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:46,002
Rise.

70
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,695
The realm owes you
a great debt, brother.

71
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,990
Come.

72
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:24,540
This is our chance...

73
00:10:24,623 --> 00:10:27,960
Daemon, he would venture off, abroad,

74
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,962
winning tournaments...

75
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,299
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

76
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,551
I will not revisit this debate.

77
00:10:35,634 --> 00:10:37,803
You were always mother's favorite.

78
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:40,056
No, it's no great mystery.

79
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,265
You were.

80
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:47,146
Our mother, she had no regard
for custom or tradition, rules.

81
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,566
And I, sadly, was no great warrior.

82
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,611
Congratulations on your victory.

83
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,409
Thank you, Princess.

84
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,626
Perhaps Prince Daemon
would care for a tour of the gallery?

85
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,461
He hasn't yet seen the new tapestries

86
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,506
gifted to you by Norvos and Qohor.

87
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:17,343
Would you like to see the tapestries?

88
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,349
He has no interest in such things.

89
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:25,893
I'd like to see them.

90
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:30,106
Then you should not deprive yourself.

91
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,984
I shall enjoy them alone.

92
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,948
More wine.

93
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:45,413
As I said, you were the favorite.

94
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:48,666
No, you were. You were. I insist.

95
00:12:04,098 --> 00:12:06,016
I surmise the tour did not go well.

96
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,561
I endured it for as long as I could.

97
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:14,692
To have every young knight and lord in
the Seven Kingdoms fawning over you...

98
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,775
What misery.

99
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:23,409
It is rare for girls in this realm to
get a choice between two suitors,

100
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:25,411
no less two score of them.

101
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:29,540
Those men and boys don't fawn over me.

102
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:32,293
They only want my name and
my Valyrian blood for their offspring.

103
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:37,173
I think it's rather romantic.

104
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:42,219
How romantic it must be
to get imprisoned in a castle

105
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,847
and made to squeeze out heirs.

106
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:50,853
Sorry.

107
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,490
How angry is he?

108
00:13:05,701 --> 00:13:08,537
The King went through
great effort to arrange your tour.

109
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,290
He is... frustrated.

110
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,376
But I am glad you are home.

111
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,550
I find I have few friends lately.

112
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,846
I like to believe I'm still
the Lady Alicent, but...

113
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,977
all anyone sees when
they look at me now is "The Queen."

114
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,148
I've missed you, too.

115
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,184
So...

116
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:14,937
what do you want?

117
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,482
Only the comforts of home.

118
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,410
I had not thought you
particularly comfortable in this home.

119
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,000
Though I do suppose you seem changed
by your adventures.

120
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,795
More mature, perhaps.

121
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,216
You've matured yourself
these last four years, Princess.

122
00:14:46,802 --> 00:14:48,846
You'll get used to the attention.

123
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,431
The attention I can endure.

124
00:14:50,514 --> 00:14:52,224
It's the rest I could do without.

125
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,268
My father seems content to sell me off

126
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,895
to whichever lord
has the biggest castle.

127
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,274
There are worse things to be sold for.

128
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,813
Such a lonely prospect.

129
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:25,025
The Step stones were meant
to be won for the realm,

130
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:27,319
but over the past few days,
it seems we have traded

131
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:29,780
a crabfeeder for a sea snake.

132
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:34,451
This is clearly a rebuke for passing
over Lady Laena for Queen Alicent.

133
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,413
Years have passed since the business
with his daughter.

134
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,540
Certainly, he cannot still be wroth?

135
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:43,669
The Sea Snake is an over-proud man,
to be sure, Your Grace.

136
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:45,754
That pride has been injured.

137
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:48,632
Perhaps we can salve the wound?

138
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,844
I fear Lord Corlys's pride
is the least of our worries.

139
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,804
I don't wish to cause
you further distress,

140
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:57,307
Your Grace, but my brother
has sent disturbing word from Old town.

141
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,311
Lord Corlys is said to have
engaged in negotiations

142
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,063
with the Sea lord of Braavos.

143
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:06,900
He plans to wed his daughter Laena
to the Sealord's son.

144
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:12,239
If House Velaryon
entered into an alliance

145
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,367
with the Free Cities

146
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:16,577
then...

147
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:21,290
we would have to seek
our own marriage pact.

148
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,342
- Good night, Ser Criston.
- Sleep well, Princess.

149
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,400
Where are we going?

150
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,260
Fuck off, boy.

151
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,514
He called me boy.

152
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,911
Do you wish to know your death, child?

153
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,514
Let me take that.

154
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,322
Leave us, all of you.

155
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,178
You have a far kinder
touch than they do.

156
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,596
Thank you, husband.

157
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:36,021
And now we come to the matter
of the great Iron Chair...

158
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:40,150
and whose bum it might bear.

159
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,152
Our good King...

160
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,613
names his daughter,

161
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,823
a girl, his heir.

162
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:54,623
But then to him, a babe is born.

163
00:23:03,423 --> 00:23:05,884
A son!

164
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:10,013
To which heir might the chair bear?

165
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,681
Who will it be?

166
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,059
The brother? The daughter?

167
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:16,436
Or the little princeling of three?

168
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:32,369
Rhaenyra... the Realm's Delight,

169
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:35,330
a girl so young and so slight...

170
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,501
loved by all of her people,

171
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,380
but would she make a powerful queen,

172
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,174
- or would she be feeble?
- Feeble!

173
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,845
Though Aegon, the babe Prince,
might long for a claim,

174
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,098
he has two things Rhaenyra cannot:

175
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,142
a conqueror's name...

176
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:57,060
and a cock.

177
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:03,358
Lies, slander! Boo!

178
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,110
Jest if you will,

179
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,112
but many of the smallfolk
are like to believe

180
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:10,031
that, as a male, Aegon
should be the heir.

181
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:13,577
Their wants are of no consequence.

182
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:20,041
They're of great consequence
if you expect to rule them one day.

183
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:25,255
For one night, I wish to be free
of the burdens of my inheritance.

184
00:24:31,845 --> 00:24:33,013
Four coppers, street rat.

185
00:24:33,096 --> 00:24:35,223
In King's Landing,
we pay for our pleasures.

186
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,101
- Hey!
- Stop! Boy!

187
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,394
Wait, I'll find him.

188
00:25:18,016 --> 00:25:21,186
And who might you be running from, now?

189
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:22,395
Ser Harwin.

190
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:24,272
Princess.

191
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,320
Don't.

192
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,948
You take care, boy.

193
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,408
Next time, you might not be so lucky.

194
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,248
Enjoyed that, did you?

195
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,711
Who knows when I'll next taste freedom?

196
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,850
Come.

197
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:06,773
Pardon me, Your Grace.

198
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,609
The King has requested your presence.

199
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:16,616
The hour is quite late.

200
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,702
Yes, Your Grace.

201
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,413
What is this place?

202
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:30,041
It's where people come
to take what they want.

203
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,732
Fucking is a pleasure, you see.

204
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,736
For the woman as it is the man.

205
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:15,503
A marriage is a duty... Yes.

206
00:29:19,924 --> 00:29:22,844
But that doesn't stop us
from doing what we want.

207
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,725
From fucking who we want.

208
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:50,932
Daemon?

209
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:31,389
Princess?

210
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:41,858
Princess, are you, are you hurt?

211
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,989
- I should alert the Lord Commander.
- No.

212
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,122
My helmet.

213
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:04,964
You finished?

214
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,510
Thank you.

215
00:32:40,750 --> 00:32:41,876
Stop.

216
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,180
Apologies for the late hour, my Lord.

217
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,328
What is it?

218
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,914
A messenger brings word
from the White Worm.

219
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,775
Am I your prisoner?

220
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:18,027
As I was once yours?

221
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,826
I'm your protector, lucky for you.

222
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,002
This will cut the fog.

223
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,508
I don't need protection
from a common whore.

224
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,051
I am not so common.

225
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:46,389
A not-so-common whore then.

226
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,016
I've left that life behind.

227
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:53,229
I learned that skin-trade
could only take me so far in this life.

228
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,357
You never were one to stay idle.

229
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:00,611
Hard lessons are not
welcomed but suffered.

230
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,297
You can pay for the
room on your way out.

231
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,407
Come.

232
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,168
What is it?

233
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,547
I apologize for the early hour,
Your Grace.

234
00:39:02,381 --> 00:39:03,716
I have...

235
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,260
discomforting news.

236
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:09,638
I thought it best shared discreetly
before the council convenes.

237
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,640
The Sea Snake.

238
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,730
I'm afraid it concerns
the Princess, my King.

239
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,983
Has she been harmed?

240
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:27,573
It is no easy thing

241
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:30,576
to tell a father of
his daughter's exploits.

242
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,871
I had considered saying nothing, but...

243
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:35,623
What has she done?

244
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:41,587
The Princess was spied last evening...

245
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,549
beyond the walls of the Keep...

246
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,677
in a pleasure house.

247
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,554
What of it?

248
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:54,225
She was carrying on with her uncle.

249
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:00,439
They were engaged in behaviors
unbecoming of a maiden...

250
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,776
of a Princess.

251
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,489
What behaviors?

252
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,664
Well, must I say it, Your Grace?

253
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:20,084
You enter my bedchamber,
accusing my daughter of something.

254
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,545
Now speak it... plainly.

255
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,051
Daemon and Rhaenyra
were seen together...

256
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,847
in the bowels of a pleasure den.

257
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,401
Coupling.

258
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,119
This is a lie.

259
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,746
You have been lied to.

260
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,958
I only wish that were true, Your Grace.

261
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,171
Who is responsible for this gossip?

262
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,674
Have this rumormonger
brought before me at once.

263
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:10,759
And I will take their eyes.

264
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:14,430
As your Hand, I must maintain trusted
sources of information.

265
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,183
And this one, as yet,
has never led me astray.

266
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:21,312
And several of the servants
have now admitted to seeing her,

267
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,938
the Princess...

268
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,691
creeping through the gates
from King's Landing,

269
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,651
disguised as a page

270
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:29,862
during the hour of the owl.

271
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,490
Are you so sick with ambition

272
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:35,492
that you would have my daughter stalked?

273
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,620
Spied upon?

274
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:41,373
Awaiting your best chance
to destroy her reputation?

275
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:45,127
I have no such intent, Your Grace.

276
00:41:45,211 --> 00:41:47,129
You think yourself a cunning man.

277
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:49,757
Your designs are obvious.

278
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:53,844
Do you wish to have your blood
on the Iron Throne so badly

279
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:56,263
that you are willing
to destroy mine own?

280
00:41:58,766 --> 00:41:59,892
Just get out.

281
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,565
Leave me... at once.

282
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,405
Your Grace.

283
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:56,073
I'm dressed, An nor a. Come.

284
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:07,084
Princess.

285
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:13,966
Come.

286
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,395
Princess, I have
a message from the Queen.

287
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:52,629
What happened last night?

288
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:56,467
What do you mean?

289
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:59,178
My father has made
some worrying allegations about you.

290
00:44:02,181 --> 00:44:03,724
Were you with your uncle?

291
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,936
Oh, I...

292
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,730
I haven't seen him in years.

293
00:44:09,813 --> 00:44:11,333
He took me into the city for some fun.

294
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,609
Tell me the whole of it, Rhaenyra.

295
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,611
Your father accused me of something.

296
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:18,739
That I drank wine?

297
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,241
Left the castle after dark?

298
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,202
That you fucked Daemon
in a pleasure house.

299
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:36,256
This is a vile accusation.

300
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,383
Is it?

301
00:44:37,466 --> 00:44:40,386
You Targaryens do have queer customs.

302
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:43,639
- And Daemon certainly knows no limit.
- Alicent...

303
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,308
Your Grace, sister,
you must know I would,

304
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:47,726
I would never.

305
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:49,269
You cannot believe such gossip.

306
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,562
My father is no gossip.

307
00:44:50,646 --> 00:44:51,873
Well, certainly he's been misled.

308
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:53,249
He could not have
witnessed such a thing.

309
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:54,942
- Why not?
- Because it did not happen.

310
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,944
- He was told that you...
- Told?

311
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:01,407
Who made these claims to your father?

312
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,287
I am the Princess.

313
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:10,999
To question my virtue
is an act of treason.

314
00:45:13,419 --> 00:45:16,088
- I do not know specifically...
- Your father did not tell you?

315
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,757
He reported it to the King.

316
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,761
I overheard.

317
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,393
So you are accusing me of slanders...

318
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,812
you overheard?

319
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,731
I only want to help you, Rhaenyra.

320
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:45,242
We drank in a tavern.

321
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,455
Several... taverns.

322
00:45:50,622 --> 00:45:52,416
It was getting late...

323
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,710
and I asked to go home.

324
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,713
But Daemon wished to continue.

325
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,968
As he was my escort,
I had no real choice.

326
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:04,261
"Continue"...

327
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,182
in a brothel?

328
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,268
He took me to a show.

329
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,064
I was only a spectator.
I didn't do anything.

330
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:24,573
And then Daemon sank into his cups and

331
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,745
abandoned me for some whore.

332
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,251
I should've known better.

333
00:46:42,424 --> 00:46:43,759
So you did not?

334
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:49,431
Must I truly refute that?

335
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,854
Daemon never touched me.

336
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:01,693
I swear this to you
upon the memory of my mother.

337
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,300
It was foolish of you to place
yourself in a position

338
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,493
where your virtue could
even come into question.

339
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,499
The King has strived
to find you a good match.

340
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,917
And so have I.

341
00:47:17,876 --> 00:47:20,003
If that lord were to think
that you had been...

342
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,006
sullied...

343
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,094
- it would ruin everything.
- I know...

344
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:28,971
Your Grace.

345
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,057
I regret it.

346
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:49,908
The King demands an audience, my Prince.

347
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:52,578
Take your fucking hands off me.

348
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:41,543
My daughter.

349
00:48:49,176 --> 00:48:51,762
Won't you even deny it?

350
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:55,641
I need to understand the charge
before I can attempt to discredit it.

351
00:48:57,017 --> 00:48:58,268
You defiled her.

352
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,612
Still, you say nothing.

353
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,989
What does it matter, brother?

354
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,324
When we were Rhaenyra's age,

355
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:14,284
we fucked our way through
most of the brothels

356
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,827
on the Street of Silk.

357
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,454
We were young men.

358
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:19,873
She is just a girl.

359
00:49:19,956 --> 00:49:22,167
- Your niece!
- Rhaenyra's a woman-grown.

360
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,670
Better her first experience
be with me than some whore.

361
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,753
You fucking...

362
00:49:27,464 --> 00:49:29,716
You have ruined her!

363
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:31,968
What lord will wed her now?
In this condition?

364
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:34,596
Who gives a fuck what some lord thinks?

365
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:38,767
You are the dragon.
Your word is truth and law.

366
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:41,311
I have spent a lifetime defending you.

367
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:44,398
But your heart is even
blacker than I thought.

368
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:48,985
I should disinherit her as I
already did you and be done with it.

369
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:51,530
Wed her to me.

370
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:56,326
When I offered up my crown,
you said I could have anything.

371
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:58,704
I want Rhaenyra.
I'll take her as she is,

372
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,747
and wed her in the
tradition of our house.

373
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:03,125
You are already wed.

374
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,836
That didn't stop Aegon the Conqueror
from taking a second wife.

375
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,255
You are no conqueror.

376
00:50:08,338 --> 00:50:11,800
You are a plague... sent to destroy me.

377
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:14,803
Give me Rhaenyra to take to wife

378
00:50:14,886 --> 00:50:18,640
and we will return the House
of the Dragon to its proper glory.

379
00:50:18,724 --> 00:50:19,975
Of course.

380
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:22,602
It's not my daughter
you lust for, is it?

381
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:24,771
It's my throne.

382
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,943
Go back to the Vale, Daemon,

383
00:50:30,026 --> 00:50:31,945
to your lawful wife.

384
00:50:32,946 --> 00:50:37,909
Strive to restore whatever
scrap of honor remains in you.

385
00:50:37,993 --> 00:50:40,829
Or don't. Matters not to me.

386
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,790
As long as you are gone
from my sight for good.

387
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:53,258
As you wish, brother.

388
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,165
Have you spoken to her?

389
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:28,835
No.

390
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,718
It is not in Rhaenyra's
nature to be deceitful.

391
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,971
I cannot say the same for your brother.

392
00:51:40,972 --> 00:51:42,307
You believe he lied?

393
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,685
How often does he speak the pure truth?

394
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:50,023
How does confessing
to such things serve him?

395
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:54,736
By reducing you.

396
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:04,538
Whatever transpired,
Rhaenyra is not innocent.

397
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,833
Only because Daemon
tried to corrupt her.

398
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:11,169
Daemon and Rhaenyra
share the blood of the dragon.

399
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:13,046
They are restless and chaotic.

400
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,882
She swore to me that
she remains a maiden.

401
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:19,135
And I believe her.

402
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:26,995
That dagger once belonged
to Aegon the Conqueror.

403
00:53:28,622 --> 00:53:30,540
It was Aenar's before that.

404
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:33,001
And before that...

405
00:53:33,919 --> 00:53:35,837
t is difficult to know.

406
00:53:41,593 --> 00:53:45,555
Before Aegon's death,
the last of the Valyrian pyromancers

407
00:53:45,639 --> 00:53:47,182
hid his song in the steel.

408
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,858
"From my blood...

409
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,820
"come the Prince That Was Promised...

410
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:06,493
and his will be the
Song of Ice and Fire."

411
00:54:10,956 --> 00:54:14,417
The responsibility I have handed to you,

412
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:16,628
the burden of this knowledge...

413
00:54:17,879 --> 00:54:21,383
it is larger than the throne, the king.

414
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:23,009
It is larger than you

415
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:25,178
and your desires.

416
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,268
Jaehaerys would've disinherited you.

417
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:33,478
For a lie?

418
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,607
You've yet to ask me for the truth
of what happened.

419
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,193
The truth does not matter, Rhaenyra.

420
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,153
Only perception.

421
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,989
You have exposed yourself.

422
00:54:44,072 --> 00:54:46,074
Now we must both
suffer the consequences.

423
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,869
Were I born a man,
I could bed whomever I wanted.

424
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,288
I could father a dozen bastards,

425
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,083
and no one in your court
would blink an eye.

426
00:54:55,166 --> 00:54:58,378
You are right...
but you were born a woman.

427
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:02,132
So you'll strip me of my titles
and name Aegon in my stead.

428
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:03,341
I would.

429
00:55:04,426 --> 00:55:08,555
But it is mine to hold the realm together,
not sow it with further division.

430
00:55:10,432 --> 00:55:13,059
Your courtship is at an end.

431
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,353
You will wed Ser Laenor Velaryon,

432
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,731
and you will do so without protest.

433
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,859
The son of the Sea Snake.

434
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:23,445
So I can be a remedy
for your political headaches.

435
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:26,322
You are my political headache!

436
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,871
Your wedding to Ser Laenor Velaryon

437
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,790
will unite the two most powerful houses
in the realm.

438
00:55:35,874 --> 00:55:39,878
With the combined strength
of our shared dragons and naval fleets,

439
00:55:39,961 --> 00:55:42,630
no one would dare to stand against us.

440
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,049
The House of the Dragon

441
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:46,593
will stand as one
for a further generation.

442
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:50,472
And what will you do about the vulture
who perches upon your throne?

443
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,348
What vulture?

444
00:55:52,974 --> 00:55:54,184
Your Hand.

445
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:59,981
Otto High tower has served two kings
loyally and faithfully.

446
00:56:01,274 --> 00:56:03,193
He wants Aegon to be named heir.

447
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:06,488
And he will stop
at nothing to see it done.

448
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:09,532
Including spying on me
to bring about my ruin.

449
00:56:10,992 --> 00:56:13,578
You speak of The Conqueror's vision

450
00:56:13,661 --> 00:56:16,915
and the need for strength
and unity across the realm.

451
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:18,625
But how can that be accomplished

452
00:56:18,708 --> 00:56:21,252
with your most trusted adviser
so self-interested?

453
00:56:21,336 --> 00:56:23,797
Every lord and lady that calls
for an audience with me,

454
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,715
every man on my small council,

455
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:28,760
and all councils past,
has been self-interested.

456
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,304
- It is unavoidable.
- I disagree.

457
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:35,558
I will do my duty as heir
and wed Ser Laenor.

458
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:40,605
But you must first do yours as king.

459
00:56:51,157 --> 00:56:53,076
Your Grace.

460
00:56:55,870 --> 00:56:56,996
Five days.

461
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:02,377
I'm sorry, Your Grace?

462
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:04,796
Though it was some time ago.

463
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:07,757
The details... they fade in memory.

464
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,303
My father was a hale and healthy warrior
and dragon rider

465
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,305
at the peak of his abilities.

466
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,808
Jaehaerys named a great royal hunt

467
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,060
to celebrate him being
named the Hand of the King.

468
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,816
Five days later my father lay dead.

469
00:57:26,693 --> 00:57:28,111
Tourneys last longer.

470
00:57:29,904 --> 00:57:32,198
Baelon the Brave,

471
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,367
rider of Vhagar,

472
00:57:34,450 --> 00:57:36,369
heir to the Iron Throne...

473
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:39,789
dead of a burst belly.

474
00:57:41,749 --> 00:57:43,168
The gods have a dark wit.

475
00:57:44,377 --> 00:57:46,296
It was a grim day.

476
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:50,133
- I recall it all too well.
- Yeah...

477
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,136
It was a good day for you.

478
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:57,098
Jaehaerys named you Hand
in Baelon's stead.

479
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:03,438
That's hardly how I
viewed it, Your Grace.

480
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:05,899
It was a duty.

481
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:12,488
You served my grand sire
nobly in his final days.

482
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,117
You are the man that
taught me how to be King.

483
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:21,664
You honor me, Your Grace.

484
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,833
Just five days...

485
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:28,922
you went from being another man
in Jaehaerys's court,

486
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,007
to the second most
powerful man in the realm.

487
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:33,468
I wonder...

488
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,722
how long did it take you
to choose yourself over your King?

489
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:41,935
Your Grace?

490
00:58:43,228 --> 00:58:45,772
I will never recover from Aemma's death.

491
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:47,899
But Alicent...

492
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:50,944
she took me through
the worst of my grief.

493
00:58:53,488 --> 00:58:56,032
She was a calculated distraction.

494
00:58:57,367 --> 00:59:00,495
I only now realize
how well-calculated it was.

495
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,997
That is an absurdity.

496
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,541
The Queen loves you...

497
00:59:06,834 --> 00:59:08,836
as I know you love her.

498
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:12,298
Your interests no longer align
with those of the realm.

499
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,759
Your judgment has been compromised.

500
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:17,345
A loyal Hand must tell his king

501
00:59:17,428 --> 00:59:20,556
a discomforting truth
from time to time, Your Grace.

502
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,183
If he doesn't...

503
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:25,603
he's failed as a servant.

504
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:29,023
You were a faithful servant, Otto.

505
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:40,576
The crown and the realm

506
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:43,579
both owe you a debt
that can never be repaid.

507
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:47,333
But I can no longer trust your judgment.

508
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:12,900
Come.

509
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,700
I hope you can forgive
the late hour, Princess.

510
01:00:25,663 --> 01:00:28,583
I took great care in its preparation.

511
01:00:31,336 --> 01:00:34,213
If not brewed properly,
it can either prove ineffective

512
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,301
- or else bear unpleasant...
- Brewed properly?

513
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:41,763
I'm sorry, what is that?

514
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,474
A tea, Princess.

515
01:00:45,266 --> 01:00:46,768
From the King.

516
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:53,024
It will rid you of any
unwanted consequences.
