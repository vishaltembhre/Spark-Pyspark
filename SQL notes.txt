- <> & != are same 
- left join & right join will help you get records with NULL incase condition wont match
- NULL records won't take part in join (except full outer join) so incase t1 have 2 NULL and t2 have 1 NULL final result will have 3 NULL records not 4 (as NULL won't take part in join)
- w1.recordDate = w2.recordDate + 1 --will add one day in date
- SELECT '2024-02-05'::DATE - INTERVAL '10 days' AS new_date; --for days
- SELECT '2024-02-05'::DATE - INTERVAL '2 months' AS new_date; --for months
- SELECT '2024-02-05'::DATE - INTERVAL '3 years' AS new_date; --for years
- LAG function - LAG(price, 1, NULL)
